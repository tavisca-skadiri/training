CODE READING
1. Starting point
2. Flow (split points help)
3. Commments (less priority, may be wrong)
4. Naming (clarity, don't keep it for later)
5. Documentation (comments that lead to documentation)
6. Readability (Naming as a whole)
7. Code layout (directory structure, industry standard layouts)
8. Test cases (valid input/output, categorizing pass and fails, 
    unit testing just methods, testing multiple flows, executing the parts you want, gain control)
9. Problem (real life understanding)
10. Execution (visual output)
